Meow! Greetingshhh!

Uh, there are two ways, why you do erased my comment about WW2, that holocaust was brutally slaying of Jews and not gays/Gypsys/Slavs/anyone...

1 - If you are anti-semitian, than shave your head bald and go to the skinhead meetings!

2 - If you doubt words of the Bible, that homosexuality is a deadly sin, make a pentagram tatoo on your forehead go to the satanistic masses with your gay pals!

3 - First and last warning, you fucking gay - I won't appreciate if any more nazi shwain would write in my page! I don't wish to talk to you anymore!

If an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered, the recantation is still perfectly valid.  If you know you are telling the truth, you will argue with machine or investigator.  Also part of Kanin's research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations.  In all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened.

As for your claims of """"stalking"""", that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation. I have assumed good faith (and good intentions) on your part, and have never suggested (or seen reason to suggest) that you might have some ulterior motive in mass-adding links to one specific company's web page. Nor, for that matter, have I ever made any suggestion that this is an """"administrative"""" matter or even mentioned such a role. (Clearly, as a party to this disagreement, I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest.) I would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me, rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. ''''''chatspy

"001d874a4d3e8813","""::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims """"despite """"Third Way"""" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force""""? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a """"Third Way"""" as the references show.

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to """"cover up"""" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -

BI, you said you wanted to talk

At the bottom of the lead section you have written:

""""Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator, but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials"""".""""

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials""""

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is

""""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures.""""

It then goes on to say

""""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""""

So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with """"presently available commercial materials.""""

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

""""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.""""

Regarding: """"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts."""" and 

""""A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts."""".""""

The full quote is:

""""HyperSkyhook

the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers.

 GA Review II 

I'm sorry to say this, but I have to fail this article's GAN. The several major problems that  brought up in this article's previous GA assessment have not been issued.

The History, Media attention, Academics, Student Government, Demographics, Trivia, and Additional Information section are very deficient in citiations. Also, Triva and Additional information should be integrated into the rest of the article."""" Again, please look over WP:WIAGA and fix these problem, then renominate it for GA-class.

Deleting the comment I posted on your 'talk page' does not delete my feelings for your hasty decision to delete my page. You, sir, are still a cock-sucking douche fuck. Sit back for a second and think about what your life has become. ............ Done? That didn't take long did it? Nope. Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker. So, go eat some more food and drown your sorrows you premature ejaculating, bald headed fuck.
